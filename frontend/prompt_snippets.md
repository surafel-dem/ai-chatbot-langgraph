Plan Prompts:

Make a detailed plan to accomplish this. Think hardest. How will we implement only the functionality we need right now? Identify files that need to be changed.
Do not include plans for legacy fallback unless required or explicitly requested.
Write a short overview of what you are about to do.
Write function names and 1-3 sentences about what they do.
Write test names and 5-10 words about behavior to cover.



Review Prompts:

"My developer just finished step 2 and I want to make sure they did a good job. Can you review their work?

I want this to be really clean, readable code, DRY, and look for opportunities where it should have edited existing code rather than adding new code."

"My developer wrote up this plan. Give me feedback on it - high level and down to the nitty gritty.

How can we improve it? Are there any big architectural changes we should make?"






Write Code

Now think hard and write elegant code that completes this. Do not add backwards compatibility unless explicitly requested. After every code block you write, lint, compile, and write corresponding tests and run them before writing the next code block.
